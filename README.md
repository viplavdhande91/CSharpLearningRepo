# Factory Pattern

#### Understanding the Problem of not using the Factory Design Pattern
 When you **do not** use the Factory Design Pattern, you may encounter various issues:
- **Tight coupling**: This occurs when your code is tightly bound to specific classes, making it impossible to change or extend the types of objects created without modifying the current code. This can result in decreased flexibility and more maintenance effort.
- **Code Duplication**: Without a factory, object creation code is frequently duplicated across the program. This redundancy can cause inconsistencies and problems in the code, making it more challenging to manage.
- **Difficulty in Testing**: Testing components based on specific implementations might be tricky. Using a factory allows you to simply change out implementations for testing, making your code more testable and reusable.
- **Scalability Issues**: As your application expands, managing object creation directly in client code can become inefficient. The Factory Design Pattern centralizes object generation, making it more scalable and maintainable.
The Factory Design Pattern addresses these concerns, resulting in more manageable, versatile, and scalable code.
