# C# Task-Based Asynchronous Programming - Concepts

This document provides a concise overview of various methods and classes used in C# for **task-based asynchronous programming**. The focus is on understanding the purpose and usage of each method conceptually.

## Task.WhenAll()

**Purpose:**  
`Task.WhenAll` is used to **wait for multiple tasks to complete**. It returns a single task that represents the completion of all the provided tasks. This method is useful when you need to run several operations concurrently and only proceed after all of them are finished.

**Use Cases:**
- Aggregating results from multiple independent operations.
- Ensuring that all background tasks are complete before continuing.

## Task.WhenAny()

**Purpose:**  
`Task.WhenAny` returns a task that completes **when any one of the provided tasks completes**. This allows you to react to whichever task finishes first, making it useful in scenarios where you want to take action as soon as possible without waiting for all tasks.

**Use Cases:**
- Handling the first available result from multiple sources.
- Implementing timeouts by combining with tasks that represent delays.

## Task.Wait()

**Purpose:**  
`Task.Wait()` is a blocking call that waits for a single task to complete. This method is typically used in scenarios where you need to ensure that a task has finished before proceeding with further code execution.

**Use Cases:**
- Ensuring sequential execution where a task must be completed before continuing.
- Simple console applications where blocking the main thread is acceptable.

## Task.Result Property

**Purpose:**  
The `Result` property is used to retrieve the outcome of a task that returns a value. If the task is not yet complete, accessing the `Result` property will block the calling thread until the task finishes.

**Use Cases:**
- Retrieving data or results from asynchronous operations.
- Synchronous access to task results in non-UI applications.

## Task.ContinueWith()

**Purpose:**  
`ContinueWith` allows you to define a continuation task that executes after the completion of a primary task. This is useful for chaining tasks together where each subsequent task depends on the completion of the previous one.

**Use Cases:**
- Sequential processing of tasks where the result of one is needed by the next.
- Error handling and cleanup operations after a task finishes.

## Nested ContinueWith() method

**Purpose:**  
Nested `ContinueWith` refers to the chaining of multiple continuation tasks, where each continuation starts after the previous one has completed. This technique is useful for building complex workflows with dependent asynchronous operations.

**Use Cases:**
- Creating complex asynchronous workflows.
- Performing sequential steps where each depends on the result of the previous.

## CancellationTokenSource Class

**Purpose:**  
`CancellationTokenSource` is used to signal cancellation of tasks or operations. By passing a `CancellationToken` to a task, you allow that task to monitor and respond to cancellation requests, enabling graceful shutdown of operations.

**Use Cases:**
- Implementing cancellable asynchronous operations.
- Managing long-running tasks that need to be stopped based on external input.
